## System Design & Architecture â€“ Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

1. **What is SOA?** â€“ A design pattern where services are reusable and loosely coupled. Think of SOA as Lego blocks; each service is independent but can connect to build a larger system.

2. **What is WSDL?** â€“ Web Services Description Language for defining service interfaces. Itâ€™s like a blueprint that tells clients how to communicate with a service.

3. **What is SOAP?** â€“ Simple Object Access Protocol for structured data exchange. Imagine it as a formal envelope carrying XML messages between services.

4. **What is UDDI?** â€“ Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration registry for web services. Think of it as a phone book where services are listed for easy discovery.

5. **Architecture Comparison â€“ SOA vs Monolithic vs Microservices** â€“ Understanding design differences. SOA is like modular components, Monolithic is a single big block, and Microservices are tiny independent blocks.

6. **SOAP Development Approaches** â€“ Styles like RPC-based and document-based SOAP services. RPC is like a direct call to a function, while document-based is exchanging structured documents.

7. **SOAP Pros & Cons** â€“ Benefits and limitations of using SOAP for service communication. Itâ€™s reliable and standardized but can be heavy compared to REST.

8. **SOAP vs REST Decision** â€“ Choosing the right protocol based on requirements. SOAP is like sending formal letters, REST is more like texting: lighter and faster.

9. **SOAP Components** â€“ Understanding key parts like Envelope, Header, and Body. Think of Envelope as a package, Header as instructions, and Body as the actual content.

10. **SOAP Elements** â€“ Detailed look at XML-based elements in SOAP messages. Each element is like a labeled section in a structured document.

11. **WSDL Components** â€“ Elements like Types, Messages, Port Types, Bindings, and Services. These define the rules and structure, similar to sections in a contract.

12. **SOA vs Web Services** â€“ How SOA is a broader concept compared to web services. SOA is the architecture, while web services are the building blocks implementing it.

13. **Top-Down vs Bottom-Up** â€“ Two main approaches for designing and developing SOAP services. Top-down starts with the contract, bottom-up starts from existing code.

14. **SOAP vs Microservices** â€“ Comparing traditional SOAP services with modern microservices. SOAP is formal and heavy, microservices are lightweight, independently deployable units.
