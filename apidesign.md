## System Design & Architecture â€“ API Design

1. **REST vs SOAP** â€“ Key differences between RESTful APIs and SOAP-based services. REST is lightweight and flexible like a simple courier, while SOAP is strict and formal like certified mail.

2. **RESTful API Design Principles** â€“ Best practices for designing scalable, maintainable APIs. Think of it as creating a well-organized highway system for data.

3. **RESTful API HTTP Methods** â€“ Understanding GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE usage. Methods are like verbs for your API: GET fetches, POST creates, PUT replaces, PATCH updates, DELETE removes.

4. **PUT vs PATCH** â€“ Differences in resource updating semantics in REST. PUT rewrites the entire resource; PATCH changes only parts, like editing a paragraph vs rewriting a whole page.

5. **Idempotent Methods** â€“ HTTP operations that produce the same result no matter how many times theyâ€™re executed. Like turning a light switch on multiple timesâ€”it stays on.

6. **Status Codes in REST** â€“ Common HTTP response codes and their meanings. Status codes are like traffic signals, guiding clients on success, errors, or redirections.

7. **API Error Handling** â€“ Designing structured error responses for REST APIs. Clear error messages are like road signs telling users exactly what went wrong.

8. **API Versioning Best Practices** â€“ Strategies for evolving APIs without breaking clients. Versioning is like releasing new editions of a book without confusing readers of older editions.

9. **Query vs Path Parameters** â€“ When to use query strings vs URL path variables. Path params identify resources; query params filter or modify results, like addresses vs search filters.

10. **HATEOAS in REST** â€“ Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State for discoverable APIs. HATEOAS is like giving a map with clickable directions inside your API responses.

11. **OpenAPI & Swagger** â€“ API documentation and testing using OpenAPI specification. Swagger is like an interactive menu for your API, letting users explore and test endpoints.

12. **Secure REST API** â€“ Techniques to secure APIs with authentication, authorization, and encryption. Securing APIs is like putting locks, ID checks, and encrypted messages to protect data.
