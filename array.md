## Data Structures â€“ Arrays

1. **What is an Array?** â€“ Introduction to arrays as contiguous memory storage for elements. Arrays are like a row of mailboxes where each slot holds a value.

2. **Characteristics of Arrays** â€“ Fixed size, index-based access, and memory layout. Think of it as a numbered shelf where each item has a fixed spot.

3. **Advantages & Disadvantages of Arrays** â€“ Strengths and limitations in programming. Arrays are fast for access but rigid in size, like a bookshelf with fixed compartments.

4. **What is a Dynamic Array?** â€“ Resizable arrays with flexible capacity. Like an expandable folder that grows as you add more papers.

5. **Time Complexity of Array Operations** â€“ Access, insertion, deletion performance. Access is instant like looking up a shelf, insertion may require shifting items.

6. **Array vs Dictionary** â€“ Comparing ordered index-based structures vs key-value pairs. Arrays are like numbered lockers, dictionaries like labeled cubbies.

7. **What is an Associative Array?** â€“ Key-based access instead of numeric indexing. Like a contact list where names fetch phone numbers.

8. **Heap vs Sorted Array** â€“ Performance trade-offs in retrieval and insertion. A heap is like a priority queue, sorted array is like a neatly ordered list.

9. **How Array Indexing Works** â€“ Understanding address calculation in arrays. Indexing is like calculating the exact slot location from the starting point.

10. **Array vs Linked List vs Stack** â€“ Comparing structure, access speed, and use cases. Arrays are contiguous, linked lists are chained, stacks follow LIFO rules.

11. **What is a Linked List?** â€“ Sequential nodes connected by pointers. Like train cars hooked together, each pointing to the next.

12. **What is a Sparse Array?** â€“ Efficient storage for mostly empty data sets. Like a parking lot with few carsâ€”no need to track empty spots.

13. **Sorted Array Time Complexity** â€“ Operation performance in ordered arrays. Searching is faster due to order, like looking in a phonebook.

14. **Dynamic Array vs Linked List** â€“ Choosing between resizable arrays and pointers. Dynamic arrays resize like elastic containers; linked lists link like chains.

15. **Array Access Complexity** â€“ O(1) access and cost of modifications. Access is direct, but inserting in the middle is like shuffling books on a shelf.

16. **Merge Sorted Arrays** â€“ Combining two sorted sequences efficiently. Like merging two sorted decks of cards while keeping order.

17. **Array vs ArrayList** â€“ Static vs dynamic sizing in Java and other languages. Arrays are fixed compartments, ArrayLists expand automatically.
